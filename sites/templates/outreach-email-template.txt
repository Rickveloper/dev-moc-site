Subject: Quick website question

Hi [Name],

I’m local to the Seacoast area and came across your business online.

I build simple, mobile-friendly websites for small businesses — nothing complicated, just something clean that works well on phones and makes it easy for customers to contact you.

If you’re ever interested in a new site or a refresh, I’d be happy to help or answer any questions.
No pressure at all.

Best,
[Your Name]
