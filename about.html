            <p>
                Harborview Inn &amp; Café is a fictional establishment inspired by the beautiful coast of southern Maine. This boutique inn began as a dream shared by our imaginary founders, a couple who fell in love with the charm of York’s rocky shores and vibrant community.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our story starts decades ago when the founders discovered a historic house overlooking the ocean. They renovated it into a welcoming bed-and-breakfast, preserving its heritage while adding modern comforts. Over time, a small seafood café was added, featuring locally inspired dishes and coastal flavors.

                Although Harborview Inn &amp; Café doesn’t exist in real life, it reflects the warmth and hospitality found along Maine’s coast. This sample site demonstrates what a clean, simple web presence can look like for a small business.
